Our welcome to Nashville AP is an easy way for visitors to search for things to do in our fine city.
We connected the serach capabilities of four APIs in one location to create a convenient way to search for restaurants, parks, events and concerts. 

Parks are searchable by feature in a dropdown menu.

Concerts are searchable by genre keywords.

Events are searchable by keyword.

Restaurants are searchable by cuisine type in a dropdown menu. 


We connected our restaurant search to the Zomato API.
We connected our park search to the Nashville Metro Gov API.
We connected our concerts search to the Ticketmaster API.
We connected our events search to the Eventbrite API.
